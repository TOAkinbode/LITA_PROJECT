### DEDUCTION FROM THE ANALYSIS
-From the analysis, it was observed that the rate of attrition was higher among the male employees, also majority of these male employees were in Research and Development Department and their average age is 37.
-The Total Number of male employees = 882
-Total number of attrition = 150
-Total number of current employee = 732
-The average age is 37.
#### CONCLUSION
It can be concluded that attrition is higher among male staff in research and development department who are around 37 years of age, this could be due to 
-1 These men are probably married and needed more income
-2 They leave as a result of important discovery during their researches that they feel could help them build their own organisation
-3 If they are exposed to leaving the country during researches, they have probably decided to relocate after exploring other countries.

#### RECOMENDATION
-The management should look into reviewing the salary scheme after certain period in the company
-Terms and conditions should be made to screen which employee can embark on researches outside the country.
