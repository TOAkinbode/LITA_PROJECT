### PROJECT OVERVIEW
This analysis explore the overall performance of employee in the Incubator Hub HR data, it pay keen attention to the employees educational background, gender and age group as it relates to the rate of attrition.
### DATA SOURCES
- Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
    1. for Data Cleaning
    2. for Analysis
    3. for Visualization
- SQL - Structured Query Language for quering of Data
- GitHub for Portfolio Building
- Power BI for building visualization base on the data received

### Data Cleaning and Preparations
In the initial phase of data cleaning and preparation, we performed the following
  1. Data Loading and Inspection
  2. Handling Missing Variables
  3. Data cleaning and formatting
  4. Creation of calculated columns in Power BI
  5. Creation of Measures to help with summary
### Exploratory Data Analysis
The data was adequately explored in Power BI, additional columns were created as calculated columns, some other information needed were calculated as measures.
### Data Analysis
Here some lines of codes or queries or even some of the DAX expressions were used during analysis
```POWER BI
Attrition Rate = sum(HR Data attrition count)/sum(HR Data employee count) 
```
Conditional columns were added to filter down some data so as to get a better visualization, one of those is the creation of conditional column to convert the Job Satisfaction column to Job Satisfaction Rating using figures 1,2,3,4 to represent each satisfactory level.

### DEDUCTION FROM THE ANALYSIS
-From the analysis, it was observed that the rate of attrition was higher among the male employees, also majority of these male employees were in Research and Development Department and their average age is 37.
-The Total Number of male employees = 882
-Total number of attrition = 150
-Total number of current employee = 732
-The average age is 37.
-The Job satisfactory rating gave an insight to the fact that some of the employee underwent attrition or were releaved of their jobs due to low performance, 46 staff among the 237 staff on attrition had a satifactory rating of Very Dissatisfied, 66 staff a rating of Dissatisfied.
#### CONCLUSION
It can be concluded that attrition is higher among male staff in research and development department who are around 37 years of age, this could be due to 
-1 These men are probably married and needed more income
-2 They leave as a result of important discovery during their researches that they feel could help them build their own organisation
-3 If they are exposed to leaving the country during researches, they have probably decided to relocate after exploring other countries.
-Majority of the male staff on attrition had their job rating to be disatisfied or very dissatisfied

#### RECOMENDATION
-The management should look into reviewing the salary scheme after certain period in the company
-Terms and conditions should be made to screen which employee can embark on researches outside the country.
-The month of probation for newly employed staff should be closely monitored to ensure satisfactory performance.
